From [this](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/insert-ascii-or-unicode-latin-based-symbols-and-characters-d13f58d3-7bcb-44a7-a4d5-972ee12e50e0) article:

> Inserting ASCII characters
>
>To insert an ASCII character, press and hold down ALT while typing the 
> character code. For example, to insert the degree (ยบ) symbol, press and hold 
> down ALT while typing 0176 on the numeric keypad.
>
> You must use the numeric keypad to type the numbers, and not the keyboard. 
> Make sure that the NUM LOCK key is on if your keyboard requires it to type 
> numbers on the numeric keypad.
> 
> Inserting Unicode characters
>
>To insert a Unicode character, type the character code [in hexadecimal, 
> does not seem to be case-sensitive], press ALT, and then press X. For 
> example, to type a dollar symbol ($), type 0024, press ALT, and then press 
> X. For more Unicode character codes, see Unicode character code charts by 
> script. 

**Note:**
* VSCode only supports inserting ASCII characters
* Word supports both
